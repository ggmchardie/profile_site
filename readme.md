### Tech Stack

* HTML

* CSS

##Design
* I began my design process my drawing basic wireframing and breaking down my content into smaller sections so it could be displayed appropraitely

* I labeled my wireframe with HTML elemens that I thought I might use so I could clearly see where things needed to be.

* I focused on getting my HTML and content up and then spent time styling with CSS.

* Naturally, as I began stlying, my design changed into something somehwat different than my original wireframing but continually updatig my trello as new tasks came up helped mestay on track with my project timeline.

###Project Timeline

###Trello boards

* I started with my HTML
![trello] (https://i.imgur.com/4oFYhmf.png)

* As my project grew, I created more boards and began adding CSS elements

* As I encountered issues that I knew would take a large period of time to correct, I would add them as an item on my board.

* I broke down each large component (e.g. HTML, CSS, readme), into small sections to help me keep a good idea of what my timeline should be.

###Design progression

###Usability considerations

My page is responsive. Width and margin of the body was set appropriately to allow this. When needed elements were given extra styling.

I broke down what was originally a large document into much smaller sections and rewrote it to make it more consice and attractive to the user. I used images where I could to represent content (e.g. my gallery section)
