            <br>
        <p>I am a web developer with a background in <br>
            education and library and information services.</p>
            
        <p>I have worked as a library assistant in both <br>
            public and private sectors and as a learning <br>
            support aide in the public school system.</p>
            
        <p>My experiences in these different<br>
            areas is what has motivated me to use the skills<br>
            and opportunities available to me to help others<br>
            and I hope to build a career based upon this.</p>

        <p>My goal is to build, and also to improve user access<br>
            to softwares and technologies that <br>
            encourage social equanimity within our global community.</p>

              <h4>Libraries & their significance</h4>
              <p>Libraries play an integral role as equalisers within our society, <br>
                for if a library exists within a community, staffed with trained <br>
                librarians, an individual’s access to our shared culture is not <br>
                dictated by how much money we have but rather the ability of<br>
                the library to provide community access to it. We often forget that <br>
                access to technology is a luxury that many people within our global <br>
                community cannot afford. This therefore increases the gap in the level <br>
                and quality of information and education received by individual’s.</p>

            </hgroup>
            
                <p>With the rise of digital media, there has been a large shift in <br>
                the way in which we relate to and access information.<br>
                As the needs of our communities have changed we are beginning <br>
                to seeing a shift from libraries being large storehouses of print <br>
                material to information platforms – a small part of a large digital <br>
                network, providing access to both print and digital material. <br>
                However, this shift has created new problems for our modern libraries – <br>
                the large cost of cataloguing vast amounts of digital and print material <br>
                and providing access to patrons as a free service. <br>
                Too often, library budgets are being cut to save other essential <br>
                services greatly inhibiting their ability to stay relevant and <br>
                provide quality access to information.</p>

                technologies without effecting the budget of the <br>
